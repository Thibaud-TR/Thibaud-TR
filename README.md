# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile!
Hello, my name is Thibaud and I am a chemical engineer by training. After spending several years working in chemistry, I acquired solid skills in problem-solving, project management, and scientific data analysis. 
I chose to embark on a new professional adventure in data analysis.
In my experiences, I have constantly dealt with data processing, whether it was to optimize industrial processes, analyze research results, or interpret trends.
My goal is to combine my scientific expertise with my new skills in data analysis to solve complex problems, bring new perspectives, and contribute to decision-making.
